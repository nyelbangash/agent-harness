# Harness — Progress Journal

(reverse chronological; one entry per working session)

## 2026-07-04 · session 1 (cont.) · Phase 2 built

**Done:** Auto lane end to end: `ImplementWorker` (worktree implement session → HARD Elixir verification gate via `Harness.Verifier` running the repo's configured test/lint/typecheck commands → up to `max_fix_cycles` feedback loops → still red demotes to plan lane with the failure transcript in the PlanWorker prompt → green means HOST commits/pushes `harness/issue-{n}-{slug}` and opens the PR via `Client.create_pull_request`, comments the issue, `pr_open`). Triage `auto` route now enqueues it. Runs console: session table + live streaming transcript (tool calls collapsed) + kill at `/runs/:id`. Mode toggle in the rail writes `mode:` back to policy.yaml (`Policy.set_mode!`, full-auto requires confirm). Promote-to-auto is live on plan-ready cards (bypasses the mode/window gate — human decision — but never the pause brakes). Board cards link to PRs. **152 tests green.** Verifier bug caught by its own test: `exec cmd` wrapping silently dropped `&& …` compound tails.

**Setup completed by Nyel:** PAT in Keychain (first token leaked via a non-TTY echo — revoked, setup task now refuses to prompt without a TTY), doctor all green, `nyelbangash/FitnessTracker` in policy.

**Phase 2 gate (to run live):** give FitnessTracker a `test_command` in policy.yaml (map form), flip mode to FULL AUTO inside a 20:00–06:00 window (or widen `full_auto_windows`), file an `xs` issue → expect a green PR with zero human input; then a deliberately failing test → expect demotion to the plan lane. Phase 1 gate (plan packet on a real issue) also still pending live run.

**Next:** Phase 3 — ideation engine + tree UI.

## 2026-07-04 · session 1 · Phase 1 built (gate run awaits repo + PAT)

**Done:** Full plan-only pipeline: PollWorker (ETag-cheap 2-min polling, human-only short-circuit, upstream-close reconciliation) → TriageWorker (`--json-schema` structured output, Elixir re-validation, one in-attempt contract retry, opus escalation < 0.4, §4.2 routing in `Triage.route/2`) → PlanWorker (worktree session, artifact verification, host-side branch publish or issue comment, `~/.harness/plans` persistence). Runs infra: RunServer Port ownership (NDJSON streaming, turn-cap kill keyed on API message ids, SIGTERM→SIGKILL, wall-clock timeout, stdin from /dev/null), RunSupervisor + Registry, kill/kill_all. Usage: SubscriptionPool strategy + poller + rate_limit_event ingest + fail-closed staleness. Mission Control: instrument-cluster Overview (4 SVG gauges, CSS-transition needles, reduced-motion), activity feed with kill buttons, needs-you queue, Issues board with route/confidence chips; visually verified in a browser against seeded data. **129 tests green** incl. a real-CLI integration test (`mix test --only real_cli`, ~11 s) that returned schema-valid triage output end to end.

**Bugs caught by tests/probes before they shipped:** DateTime struct-vs-instant comparison would have re-triaged every issue every poll; assistant events split per content block would have over-counted turns and tripped the cap early; the CLI's 3-second stdin wait on Ports.

**Next:** Nyel runs `mix harness.setup` (PAT) + `mix harness.install` (launchd), adds a repo to `ops/policy.yaml → github.repos`, then runs the Phase 1 gate: assign an issue, expect PLAN.md + CONTEXT.md ≤ 15 min, live on the board. Then Phase 2 (auto lane + run console).

**Adversarial review (28-agent workflow):** 22 confirmed findings, all addressed. Highlights: RunServer now traps exits with a terminate/2 that SIGTERMs the claude process on daemon shutdown (no orphaned sessions / ghost "running" rows); a new `Harness.Janitor` cron reconciles stale runs, unwedges crashed issues, and level-triggers re-triage when GitHub updates land mid-flight; Oban unique got `period: :infinity` (the 60s default allowed duplicate model sessions); git ops moved to a Port-based runner that actually kills timed-out git processes; §9.2 pre-push guard (harness/* branches only, never default); prompt sanitization against trust-boundary delimiter forgery; usage endpoint shape-drift now counts as failure (was silently pausing all lanes as "fresh"); kill-switch races caught; `mix harness.stop` verifies pids are still claude before signaling; UI: stale-banner tick, live elapsed counters, bounded activity stream, missing --font-body token.

**Blockers:** none in code; gate needs the two interactive steps above.

## 2026-07-04 · session 1 · Phase 0 COMPLETE (launchd install awaits Nyel)

**Gate results:** `mix harness.doctor` all green (PAT + launchd rows are warns by design — see below). `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=… mix run` refuses to boot with exit 1. Policy hot-reload verified against a live dev server. Prod compile + assets.deploy + boot verified serving HTTP 200 on 127.0.0.1:4040. 30 tests green.

**Awaiting Nyel (two interactive steps):**
1. `mix harness.setup` — prompts for the fine-grained GitHub PAT (Contents RW, Issues RW, Pull requests RW, scoped to policy repos) and stores it in the Keychain.
2. `mix harness.install` — bootstraps the launchd LaunchAgent (permission classifier correctly refused to let the agent self-install a persistent daemon).

**Known nit:** transient `Exqlite database is locked` errors at boot while the pool races the auto-migrator; connections retry and recover. Cosmetic; revisit if it ever crash-loops under launchd KeepAlive.

## 2026-07-04 · session 1 · Phase 0 (planning notes)

**Done:** Plan approved (see `~/.claude/plans/sunny-tickling-forest.md` for the full Phase 0+1 plan). Repo initialized at `~/Documents/ProjectEx` (Nyel's call: ProjectEx *is* the repo; spec's `/Users/nyel/agent-harness` paths corrected throughout). Spec committed verbatim as HANDOFF-agentic-harness.md.

**Verified before building** (probed CLI 2.1.195 + adversarially fact-checked live docs):
- `--json-schema` gives CLI-validated `structured_output` — used for triage. `--max-turns` works (hidden from --help).
- `claude auth status --json` is the subscription boot assertion (spec's `claude /status` isn't a headless surface).
- stream-json requires `--verbose`; emits `rate_limit_event` (free five-hour usage signal) + `result.subtype` (branch on subtype, never is_error).
- Oban 2.23 Lite engine on SQLite: Cron/unique work single-node; must set `default_transaction_mode: :immediate`; no async DB tests; never two app instances on one DB file.
- GitHub: per-repo assignee query + free authorized 304s (ETags); push via ephemeral credential helper; PAT + app must live in the gui launchd domain (Keychain).
- Usage endpoint is undocumented; UA `claude-code/<ver>` required; fail closed to plan_only on staleness.

**Decisions:** policy.yaml = spec §7 exactly + 4 flagged additions (plan.post_to_issue, triage/plan max_turns, low_confidence_floor 0.4); `dontAsk` permission mode instead of acceptEdits (deny-by-default headless); PlanWorker rides :implement queue (no :plan queue in spec's fixed set); model-proposed `skip` demotes to plan (spec-literal); host does all git commits/pushes, agents only write files.

**Next:** Phase 0 chunks 0.1–0.4, then `mix harness.doctor` gate.

**Blockers:** none.
